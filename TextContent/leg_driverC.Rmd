Carbon balance estimates for different mobilization strategies. Mean estimates are represented by symbols, with the error bars representing the confidence intervals. Boxplots represent the distribution of recorded data with whiskers representing the 5, 25, 50, 75 and 95% quantiles. The bracketed numbers indicate the number of studies and the number of records underlying each estimate, respectively. The stars represent the level of significance with respect to p-value with *** for p-value<0.001, ** for p-value<0.01, * for p-value<0.05, . for p-value<0.1 The mobilization strategies are ordered by estimate size.
