# Methods
Here we define the concept of **carbon balance (CB)** as all change in carbon balance resulting from an increase in wood use. With this definition in mind, literature on forest science, life cycle analysis (LCA), energy and construction engineering and applied economics was systematically and critically reviewed in the form of a meta-analysis to assess: (1) available methodologies and current practices for quantifying substitution as well as (2) the effect of biological, physical and socio-economical drivers and system’s boundaries on substitution estimates.
Carbon balance (CB) is quantified using  carbon sequestration based on the sequestered carbon in the reference $C_{reference}$ and alternative $C_{alternative}$ scenarios respectively, and for substitution on the amount of wood used $Q_{reference}$ and $Q_{alternative}$.

$$ 
CB = \frac{ C_{alternative} - C_{reference}}{ Q_{alternative} - Q_{reference}} 
$$

<figcaption>SConceptual scheme of the carbon fluxes in the forestry value chain for a wood-based alternative (top) compared to a reference fossil-based scenario (bottom). Five stages, i.e., forest growth, extraction, production, operation, and end-of-life can be distinguished along the value chain. For each stage emissions (upward) and sequestration (downward) is represented by arrows with the relative weight of the fluxes indicated by the coloured boxes below the arrows. Carbon fluxes may be biogenic, i.e., originating from biomass, or fossil, i.e., originating from fossil extraction. Processes occur in-situ, i.e., in the forest, or ex-situ, i.e., out of the forest. For each scenario, the carbon balance of the atmosphere is shown by grey boxes which equal to the sum of all boxes, biogenic and fossil, in the scenario, emissions being counted as positive and sequestration being counted as negative. The difference between the scenarios is the change in the growth rate of the atmospheric CO2 concentration termed carbon benefit in the remainder of this study. The main processes are shown by a number 1: net ecosystem carbon flux between the land and the atmosphere, 2: harvest impact on soil carbon, 3: harvest residues decomposition, 4: end-of-life wood burning or landfill decomposition, 5: carbon storage in wood products, 6: forestry machinery energy-based emissions, 7: manufacturing machinery energy-based emissions, 8: wood products maintenance emissions (heating, renovating), 9: disposal energy-based emissions. </figcaption>
