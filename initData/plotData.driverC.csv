Karst) stands under the changing climate. We employed a forest ecosystem model and life cycle assessment tool. In particular, we studied the effects of thinning, nitrogen fertilization, and rotation length on: (1) the production of timber and energy biomass, and its economic profitability (net present value), (2) carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and carbon balance in forestry, and (3) carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the use of biomass in energy production. Results showed that the current Finnish baseline management with and without nitrogen fertilization resulted in the highest mean annual timber production and net present value (NPV) for long rotations (60 to 80 years), regardless of climate scenario. Mean annual production of energy biomass was enhanced by increasing stocking by 20-30 % compared to the baseline management, and/or use of nitrogen fertilization. Such management gave lower CO2 emissions per unit of energy compared to the baseline management, as the carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and the carbon balance in forestry increased. Overall, the carbon neutrality and net present value were, on average, the highest in the baseline management or with a 20 % increase in stocking, with nitrogen fertilization and 60- to 80-year rotation lengths, regardless of the climate applied. However, it was not possible to simultaneously maximize the NPV of forest biomass production and the carbon neutrality of bioenergy use.","BioEnergy Res.","Article",2014,23,"10.1007/s12155-013-9372-x",NA,"Pyorala_2014","included","TH","SL","v6","VB","Management","R30 30-50 years","RB 30-50 years",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,"cutting intensity","Silviculture for removals","Roundwood","mean annual production of energy biomass","Table2","m3 ha-1 a-1",3.3,3.5,"1.0606060606060606",0.2,0.408163265306123,"Emissions positive","Table 5","g CO2m−2 a−1","-171","-19.5",NA,151.5,NA,1.515,3.71175,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"refOK",3.3,3.5,0.408163265306123,171,19.5,-1.515,-3.71175,-0.885964912280702,"prd","loc","Finland",NA,NA,50,"31-70",0,1,0,1,NA,2,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","0","Timber","0",1,"Statistics Finalns (ref 47 in the paper)",NA,NA,1,"external DF used",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,"simulation time depends on rotation length so the time boundary is not consistent for the effect of rotation length",NA,"no",NA,"change wood variable to harvested m3",NA,"ongoing QC","cutting intensity","",0.001,"Increased cutting intensity","Mobilize additional wood by increased forest harvest"

We study the trade-offs and synergies between these strategies using three different Finnish national-level forest scenarios between 2015 and 2044 as examples. We demonstrate how GHG emissions change when wood harvest rates are increased. We take into account CO2 and other greenhouse gas flows in the forest, the decay rate of harvested wood products and fossil-based CO2 emissions that can be avoided by substituting alternative materials with wood derived from increased harvests. We considered uncertainties of key parameters by using stochastic simulation. According to our results, an increase in harvest rates in Finland increased the total net GHG flow to the atmosphere virtually certainly or very likely, given the uncertainties and time frame considered. This was because the increased biomass-based CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere together with decreased carbon sequestration into the forest were very likely higher than the avoided fossil-based CO2 emissions. The reverse of this conclusion would require that compared to what was studied in this paper, the share of long-living wood products in the product mix would be higher, carbon dioxide from bioenergy production would be captured and stored, and reduction in forest carbon equivalent net sink due to wood harvesting would be minimized.","Mitig.

We study the trade-offs and synergies between these strategies using three different Finnish national-level forest scenarios between 2015 and 2044 as examples. We demonstrate how GHG emissions change when wood harvest rates are increased. We take into account CO2 and other greenhouse gas flows in the forest, the decay rate of harvested wood products and fossil-based CO2 emissions that can be avoided by substituting alternative materials with wood derived from increased harvests. We considered uncertainties of key parameters by using stochastic simulation. According to our results, an increase in harvest rates in Finland increased the total net GHG flow to the atmosphere virtually certainly or very likely, given the uncertainties and time frame considered. This was because the increased biomass-based CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere together with decreased carbon sequestration into the forest were very likely higher than the avoided fossil-based CO2 emissions. The reverse of this conclusion would require that compared to what was studied in this paper, the share of long-living wood products in the product mix would be higher, carbon dioxide from bioenergy production would be captured and stored, and reduction in forest carbon equivalent net sink due to wood harvesting would be minimized.","Mitig.

However, planning horizons and response time to changes in forest management are usually long and the respective GHG effects related to the use of wood depend on the availability of harvested wood. Therefore, an integral long-term strategic approach is required to formulate the most effective forest and wood management strategies for mitigating climate change. The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

Here we present results from a comparative analysis that examined mitigation options for British Columbia's forest sector. Mitigation scenarios were evaluated using a systems perspective that takes into account the changes in emissions and removals in forest ecosystems, in harvested wood product (HWP) carbon stocks, and in other sectors where wood products substitute for emission-intensive materials and fossil fuels. All mitigation activities were assessed relative to a forward-looking 'business as usual' baseline for three implementation levels. In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO(2)e year(-1)over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO(2)e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 MtCO(2)increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 MtCO(2)e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for theHigher Recoveryscenario in 2070. Conclusions The analyses conducted in this study contribute to the global understanding of forest sector mitigation options by providing an integrated framework to synthesize the methods, assumptions, datasets and models needed to quantify mitigation activities using a systems approach. An understanding of economically feasible and socio-economically attractive mitigation scenarios along with trade offs for environmental indicators relating to species composition and age, helps decision makers with long-term planning for land sector contributions to GHG emission reduction efforts, and provides valuable information for stakeholder consultations.","Carbon Balanc.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

In particular, we studied the effects of thinning, nitrogen fertilization, and rotation length on: (1) the production of timber and energy biomass, and its economic profitability (net present value), (2) carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and carbon balance in forestry, and (3) carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the use of biomass in energy production. Results showed that the current Finnish baseline management with and without nitrogen fertilization resulted in the highest mean annual timber production and net present value (NPV) for long rotations (60 to 80 years), regardless of climate scenario. Mean annual production of energy biomass was enhanced by increasing stocking by 20-30 % compared to the baseline management, and/or use of nitrogen fertilization. Such management gave lower CO2 emissions per unit of energy compared to the baseline management, as the carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and the carbon balance in forestry increased. Overall, the carbon neutrality and net present value were, on average, the highest in the baseline management or with a 20 % increase in stocking, with nitrogen fertilization and 60- to 80-year rotation lengths, regardless of the climate applied. However, it was not possible to simultaneously maximize the NPV of forest biomass production and the carbon neutrality of bioenergy use.","BioEnergy Res.","Article",2014,23,"10.1007/s12155-013-9372-x",NA,"Pyorala_2014","included","TH","SL","v6","VB","Management","R30F 30-50 years","RBF 30-50 years",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,"cutting intensity","Silviculture for removals","Roundwood","mean annual production of energy biomass","Table2","m3 ha-1 a-1",3.65,3.8,"1.0410958904109588",0.15,0.306122448979592,"Emissions positive","Table 5","g CO2m−2 a−1","-236.5","-189",NA,47.5,NA,0.475,1.55166666666667,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"refOK",3.65,3.8,0.306122448979592,236.5,189,-0.475,-1.55166666666667,-0.200845665961945,"prd","loc","Finland",NA,NA,50,"31-70",0,1,0,1,NA,2,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","0","Timber","0",1,"Statistics Finalns (ref 47 in the paper)",NA,NA,1,"external DF used",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no",NA,"change wood variable to harvested m3",NA,"ongoing QC","cutting intensity","",0.001,"Increased cutting intensity","Mobilize additional wood by increased forest harvest"

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Here we present results from a comparative analysis that examined mitigation options for British Columbia's forest sector. Mitigation scenarios were evaluated using a systems perspective that takes into account the changes in emissions and removals in forest ecosystems, in harvested wood product (HWP) carbon stocks, and in other sectors where wood products substitute for emission-intensive materials and fossil fuels. All mitigation activities were assessed relative to a forward-looking 'business as usual' baseline for three implementation levels. In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO(2)e year(-1)over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO(2)e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 MtCO(2)increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 MtCO(2)e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for theHigher Recoveryscenario in 2070. Conclusions The analyses conducted in this study contribute to the global understanding of forest sector mitigation options by providing an integrated framework to synthesize the methods, assumptions, datasets and models needed to quantify mitigation activities using a systems approach. An understanding of economically feasible and socio-economically attractive mitigation scenarios along with trade offs for environmental indicators relating to species composition and age, helps decision makers with long-term planning for land sector contributions to GHG emission reduction efforts, and provides valuable information for stakeholder consultations.","Carbon Balanc.

The components of the net carbon exchange include the uptake of carbon into biomass, the decomposition of litter and humus, emissions from forest management operations and carbon released from the combustion of biomass and degradation of wood-based products. The tool enables the allocation of the total carbon emissions to the timber and energy biomass and to the energy produced on the basis of biomass. In example computations, ecosystem model simulations were utilized as an input to the tool. We present results for traditional timber production (pulpwood and saw logs) and integrated timber and bioenergy production (logging residues, stumps and roots) for Norway spruce, in boreal conditions in Finland, with two climate scenarios over one rotation period. The results showed that the magnitude of management related emissions on net carbon exchange was smaller when compared with the total ecosystem fluxes; decomposition being the largest emission contributor. In addition, the effects of management and climate were higher on the decomposition of new humus compared with old humus. The results also showed that probable increased biomass growth, obtained under the changing climate (CC), could not compensate for decomposition and biomass combustion related carbon loss in southern Finland. In our examples, the emissions allocated for the energy from biomass in southern Finland were 172 and 188 kg CO2 MW h(-1) in the current climate and in a CC, respectively, and 199 and 157 kg CO2 MW h(-1) in northern Finland. This study concludes that the tool is suitable for estimating the net carbon exchange of forest production. The tool also enables the allocation of direct and indirect carbon emissions, related to forest production over its life cycle, in different environmental conditions and for alternative time periods and land uses. Simulations of forest management regimes together with the CC give new insights into ecologically sustainable forest bioenergy and timber production, as well as climate change mitigation options in boreal forests.","GCB Bioenergy","Article",2011,49,"10.1111/j.1757-1707.2011.01101.x",NA,"Kilpelainen_2011","included","SC",NA,"v5","SL","supply chain","traditional timber production regime Southern Finland","integrated timber Southern Finland",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"supply chain organization","Supply chain","Roundwood","Quantity of logs, pulp and energy wood harvested","Table 2 (TP, CU vs BP, CU)","g CO2eq/m2/year",85,222,"2.611764705882353",137,0.000162091620809725,"Emissions positive","Table 2 (TP, CU vs BP, CU)","g CO2eq/m2/year","-319","-110",0.344827586206897,209,NA,0.000209,1.28939422627737,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"refOK",85,222,0.000162091620809725,319,110,-0.000209,-1.28939422627737,-0.655172413793103,"reg","reg","Finland",NA,NA,80,"71-100",0,1,1,1,NA,3,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","Pulp/Paper","Timber","0",0,"0","0","0",0,"explicit C balance",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,"checked","supply chain organization","",0.001,"Better organizing supply chain","Make better use of wood"

To assess the potential of the mitigation options arising from these carbon flows, the forest-based sector in Austria was modelled to assess causal links, dependencies and dynamics involved in GHG-relevant processes. Carbon dynamics were investigated in forests and forest soil carbon, the forest product chain and life-cycle analyses for substitution of conventional products with wood products in a cascade of different modelling approaches and paradigms, and the results synthesized. It was found that material use of products from domestic timber sources has the highest climate change mitigation efficiency when originating from sustainably managed forests regarding biomass stocks. The emissions saved through building up a carbon stock from harvested wood products and through emissions substitution can be as high as similar to 20 years of total annual Austrian emissions in 90 years.

However, planning horizons and response time to changes in forest management are usually long and the respective GHG effects related to the use of wood depend on the availability of harvested wood. Therefore, an integral long-term strategic approach is required to formulate the most effective forest and wood management strategies for mitigating climate change. The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

We present results for traditional timber production (pulpwood and saw logs) and integrated timber and bioenergy production (logging residues, stumps and roots) for Norway spruce, in boreal conditions in Finland, with two climate scenarios over one rotation period. The results showed that the magnitude of management related emissions on net carbon exchange was smaller when compared with the total ecosystem fluxes; decomposition being the largest emission contributor. In addition, the effects of management and climate were higher on the decomposition of new humus compared with old humus. The results also showed that probable increased biomass growth, obtained under the changing climate (CC), could not compensate for decomposition and biomass combustion related carbon loss in southern Finland. In our examples, the emissions allocated for the energy from biomass in southern Finland were 172 and 188 kg CO2 MW h(-1) in the current climate and in a CC, respectively, and 199 and 157 kg CO2 MW h(-1) in northern Finland. This study concludes that the tool is suitable for estimating the net carbon exchange of forest production. The tool also enables the allocation of direct and indirect carbon emissions, related to forest production over its life cycle, in different environmental conditions and for alternative time periods and land uses. Simulations of forest management regimes together with the CC give new insights into ecologically sustainable forest bioenergy and timber production, as well as climate change mitigation options in boreal forests.","GCB Bioenergy","Article",2011,49,"10.1111/j.1757-1707.2011.01101.x",NA,"Kilpelainen_2011","included","SC",NA,"v5","SL","supply chain","traditional timber production regime Northern Finland","integrated timber Northern Finland",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"supply chain organization","Supply chain","Roundwood","Quantity of logs, pulp and energy wood harvested","Table 2 (TP, CU vs BP, CU)","g CO2eq/m2/year",84,228,"2.7142857142857144",144,0.00017037367442774,"Emissions positive","Table 2 (TP, CU vs BP, CU)","g CO2eq/m2/year","-214","-51",0.238317757009346,163,NA,0.000163,0.956720576388889,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"refOK",84,228,0.00017037367442774,214,51,-0.000163,-0.956720576388889,-0.761682242990654,"reg","reg","Finland",NA,NA,80,"71-100",0,1,1,1,NA,3,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","Pulp/Paper","Timber","0",0,"0","0","0",0,"explicit C balance",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,"checked","supply chain organization","",0.001,"Better organizing supply chain","Make better use of wood"

This study quantifies the carbon costs and benefits for the French forestry sector in meeting these targets. A forest growth and harvest simulator was developed for French forests using recent forest inventory data, and the wood-use chain was reconstructed from national wood product statistics. We then projected wood production, bioenergy production, and carbon balance for three realistic intensification scenarios and a business-as-usual scenario. These intensification scenarios targeted either overstocked, harvest-delayed or currently actively managed stands. Results: All three intensification strategies produced 11.6-12.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent per year of wood-based energy by 2026, which corresponds to the target assigned to French wood-energy to meet the EU 2020 renewable energy target. Sustaining this level past 2026 will be challenging, let alone further increasing it. Although energy production targets can be reached, the management intensification required will degrade the near-term carbon balance of the forestry sector, compared to continuing present-day management. Even for the best-performing intensification strategy, i.e., reducing the harvest diameter of actively managed stands, the carbon benefits would only become apparent after 2040. The carbon balance of a strategy putting abandoned forests back into production would only break even by 2055; the carbon balance from increasing thinning in managed but untended stands would not break even within the studied time periods, i.e. 2015-2045 and 2046-2100. Owing to the temporal dynamics in the components of the carbon balance, i.e., the biomass stock in the forest, the carbon stock in wood products, and substitution benefits, the merit order of the examined strategies varies over time. Conclusions: No single solution was found to improve the carbon balance of the forestry sector by 2040 in a way that also met energy targets. We therefore searched for the intensification scenario that produces energy at the lowest carbon cost. Reducing rotation time of actively managed stands is slightly more efficient than targeting harvest-delayed stands, but in both cases, each unit of energy produced has a carbon cost that only turns into a benefit between 2060 and 2080.","Carbon Balanc.

However, planning horizons and response time to changes in forest management are usually long and the respective GHG effects related to the use of wood depend on the availability of harvested wood. Therefore, an integral long-term strategic approach is required to formulate the most effective forest and wood management strategies for mitigating climate change. The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

When looking at forest carbon cycles there is potential in utilizing another feedback cycle, namely the carbon cycle involving harvested wood products. To assess the potential of the mitigation options arising from these carbon flows, the forest-based sector in Austria was modelled to assess causal links, dependencies and dynamics involved in GHG-relevant processes. Carbon dynamics were investigated in forests and forest soil carbon, the forest product chain and life-cycle analyses for substitution of conventional products with wood products in a cascade of different modelling approaches and paradigms, and the results synthesized. It was found that material use of products from domestic timber sources has the highest climate change mitigation efficiency when originating from sustainably managed forests regarding biomass stocks. The emissions saved through building up a carbon stock from harvested wood products and through emissions substitution can be as high as similar to 20 years of total annual Austrian emissions in 90 years. Additional conservation measures while sustaining sawnwood production and the related GHG benefits at a high level had the highest contribution to an overall carbon sink.","Carbon Manag.","Article",2016,27,"10.1080/17583004.2016.1230990",NA,"Braun_2016","included","AV",NA,"v5","SL","managed area","scenario 2","R",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,"area subject to harvest","Silviculture for removals","HWP","m3 utilized wood","Fig. 7 (mean annual flux * years for material and energy)","Gm3",1.16745219134297,1.80514078498292,"1.5462224477958166",0.637688593639949,637688593.639949,"Sequestration positive","fig8 (Total)","GtCO2-eq","1.93686006825938","1.4146757679180799",0.730396475770923,-0.5221843003413,NA,-522184300.3413,-0.818870378973934,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"refOK",1.16745219134297,1.80514078498292,637688593.639949,1.93686006825938,1.41467576791808,-522184300.3413,-0.818870378973934,-0.269603524229077,"coy","reg","Austria",2010,2100,90,"71-100",0,1,1,1,NA,3,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","Pulp/Paper","Timber","1",0,"0","0","0",1,"self-calculated DF",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,"m3 utilized wood calculated from CCME to account for both wood products and biomass for energy.

This study quantifies the carbon costs and benefits for the French forestry sector in meeting these targets. A forest growth and harvest simulator was developed for French forests using recent forest inventory data, and the wood-use chain was reconstructed from national wood product statistics. We then projected wood production, bioenergy production, and carbon balance for three realistic intensification scenarios and a business-as-usual scenario. These intensification scenarios targeted either overstocked, harvest-delayed or currently actively managed stands. Results: All three intensification strategies produced 11.6-12.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent per year of wood-based energy by 2026, which corresponds to the target assigned to French wood-energy to meet the EU 2020 renewable energy target. Sustaining this level past 2026 will be challenging, let alone further increasing it. Although energy production targets can be reached, the management intensification required will degrade the near-term carbon balance of the forestry sector, compared to continuing present-day management. Even for the best-performing intensification strategy, i.e., reducing the harvest diameter of actively managed stands, the carbon benefits would only become apparent after 2040. The carbon balance of a strategy putting abandoned forests back into production would only break even by 2055; the carbon balance from increasing thinning in managed but untended stands would not break even within the studied time periods, i.e. 2015-2045 and 2046-2100. Owing to the temporal dynamics in the components of the carbon balance, i.e., the biomass stock in the forest, the carbon stock in wood products, and substitution benefits, the merit order of the examined strategies varies over time. Conclusions: No single solution was found to improve the carbon balance of the forestry sector by 2040 in a way that also met energy targets. We therefore searched for the intensification scenario that produces energy at the lowest carbon cost. Reducing rotation time of actively managed stands is slightly more efficient than targeting harvest-delayed stands, but in both cases, each unit of energy produced has a carbon cost that only turns into a benefit between 2060 and 2080.","Carbon Balanc.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

However, planning horizons and response time to changes in forest management are usually long and the respective GHG effects related to the use of wood depend on the availability of harvested wood. Therefore, an integral long-term strategic approach is required to formulate the most effective forest and wood management strategies for mitigating climate change. The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

This study quantifies the carbon costs and benefits for the French forestry sector in meeting these targets. A forest growth and harvest simulator was developed for French forests using recent forest inventory data, and the wood-use chain was reconstructed from national wood product statistics. We then projected wood production, bioenergy production, and carbon balance for three realistic intensification scenarios and a business-as-usual scenario. These intensification scenarios targeted either overstocked, harvest-delayed or currently actively managed stands. Results: All three intensification strategies produced 11.6-12.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent per year of wood-based energy by 2026, which corresponds to the target assigned to French wood-energy to meet the EU 2020 renewable energy target. Sustaining this level past 2026 will be challenging, let alone further increasing it. Although energy production targets can be reached, the management intensification required will degrade the near-term carbon balance of the forestry sector, compared to continuing present-day management. Even for the best-performing intensification strategy, i.e., reducing the harvest diameter of actively managed stands, the carbon benefits would only become apparent after 2040. The carbon balance of a strategy putting abandoned forests back into production would only break even by 2055; the carbon balance from increasing thinning in managed but untended stands would not break even within the studied time periods, i.e. 2015-2045 and 2046-2100. Owing to the temporal dynamics in the components of the carbon balance, i.e., the biomass stock in the forest, the carbon stock in wood products, and substitution benefits, the merit order of the examined strategies varies over time. Conclusions: No single solution was found to improve the carbon balance of the forestry sector by 2040 in a way that also met energy targets. We therefore searched for the intensification scenario that produces energy at the lowest carbon cost. Reducing rotation time of actively managed stands is slightly more efficient than targeting harvest-delayed stands, but in both cases, each unit of energy produced has a carbon cost that only turns into a benefit between 2060 and 2080.","Carbon Balanc.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

However, planning horizons and response time to changes in forest management are usually long and the respective GHG effects related to the use of wood depend on the availability of harvested wood. Therefore, an integral long-term strategic approach is required to formulate the most effective forest and wood management strategies for mitigating climate change. The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

This study quantifies the carbon costs and benefits for the French forestry sector in meeting these targets. A forest growth and harvest simulator was developed for French forests using recent forest inventory data, and the wood-use chain was reconstructed from national wood product statistics. We then projected wood production, bioenergy production, and carbon balance for three realistic intensification scenarios and a business-as-usual scenario. These intensification scenarios targeted either overstocked, harvest-delayed or currently actively managed stands. Results: All three intensification strategies produced 11.6-12.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent per year of wood-based energy by 2026, which corresponds to the target assigned to French wood-energy to meet the EU 2020 renewable energy target. Sustaining this level past 2026 will be challenging, let alone further increasing it. Although energy production targets can be reached, the management intensification required will degrade the near-term carbon balance of the forestry sector, compared to continuing present-day management. Even for the best-performing intensification strategy, i.e., reducing the harvest diameter of actively managed stands, the carbon benefits would only become apparent after 2040. The carbon balance of a strategy putting abandoned forests back into production would only break even by 2055; the carbon balance from increasing thinning in managed but untended stands would not break even within the studied time periods, i.e. 2015-2045 and 2046-2100. Owing to the temporal dynamics in the components of the carbon balance, i.e., the biomass stock in the forest, the carbon stock in wood products, and substitution benefits, the merit order of the examined strategies varies over time. Conclusions: No single solution was found to improve the carbon balance of the forestry sector by 2040 in a way that also met energy targets. We therefore searched for the intensification scenario that produces energy at the lowest carbon cost. Reducing rotation time of actively managed stands is slightly more efficient than targeting harvest-delayed stands, but in both cases, each unit of energy produced has a carbon cost that only turns into a benefit between 2060 and 2080.","Carbon Balanc.

To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH).

Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways.

However, planning horizons and response time to changes in forest management are usually long and the respective GHG effects related to the use of wood depend on the availability of harvested wood. Therefore, an integral long-term strategic approach is required to formulate the most effective forest and wood management strategies for mitigating climate change. The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

We evaluated forest sector carbon trends and potential mitigation scenarios in Vermont using a systems-based modeling framework that accounts for net emissions from all forest sector components. These components comprise (1) the forest ecosystem, including land-use change, (2) harvested wood products (HWP), and (3) substitution effects associated with using renewable wood-based products and fuels in place of more emission-intensive materials and fossil fuel-based energy. We assessed baseline carbon trends from 1995 through 2050 using a business as usual (BAU) scenario. Emission reductions associated with different forest management and HWP scenarios were evaluated relative to the BAU scenario from 2020 to 2050. We estimated uncertainty for each forest sector component and used a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the distribution of cumulative total mitigation for each scenario relative to baseline. Our analysis indicates that the strength of the forest sector carbon sink in Vermont has been declining and will continue to decline over coming decades under the BAU scenario. However, several scenarios evaluated here could be effective in reducing emissions and enhancing carbon uptake. Shifting HWP to longer-lived commodities resulted in a 14% reduction in net cumulative emissions by 2050, the largest reduction of all scenarios. A scenario that combined extending harvest rotations, utilizing additional harvest residues for bioenergy, and increasing forest productivity resulted in a 12% reduction in net cumulative emissions. Shifting commodities from pulp and paper to bioenergy showed a 7.3% reduction in emissions. In contrast, shortening rotations to increase harvests for bioenergy use resulted in a 5.5% increase in emissions. In summary, model simulations suggest that net emissions could be reduced by up to 14% relative to BAU, depending on the management and HWP-use scenario. Combining multiple scenarios could further enhance reductions. However, realizing the full climate mitigation potential of these forests may be challenging due to socioeconomic barriers to implementation, as well as alternative management objectives that must be considered along with carbon sequestration.","Ecol.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways.

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways.

However, planning horizons and response time to changes in forest management are usually long and the respective GHG effects related to the use of wood depend on the availability of harvested wood. Therefore, an integral long-term strategic approach is required to formulate the most effective forest and wood management strategies for mitigating climate change. The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, planning horizons and response time to changes in forest management are usually long and the respective GHG effects related to the use of wood depend on the availability of harvested wood. Therefore, an integral long-term strategic approach is required to formulate the most effective forest and wood management strategies for mitigating climate change. The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Additionally, they provide many other important ecosystem services (ESs), but are vulnerable to climate change; therefore, adaptation is necessary. Climate-smart forestry combines mitigation with adaptation, whilst facilitating the provision of many ESs. This is particularly challenging due to large uncertainties about future climate. Here, we combined ecosystem modeling with robust multi-criteria optimization to assess how the provision of various ESs (climate change mitigation, timber provision, local cooling, water availability, and biodiversity habitat) can be guaranteed under a broad range of climate futures across Europe. Our optimized portfolios contain 29% unmanaged forests, and implicate a successive conversion of 34% of coniferous to broad-leaved forests (11% vice versa). Coppices practically vanish from Southern Europe, mainly due to their high water requirement. We find the high shares of unmanaged forests necessary to keep European forests a carbon sink while broad-leaved and unmanaged forests contribute to local cooling through biogeophysical effects. Unmanaged forests also pose the largest benefit for biodiversity habitat. However, the increased shares of unmanaged and broad-leaved forests lead to reductions in harvests. This raises the question of how to meet increasing wood demands without transferring ecological impacts elsewhere or enhancing the dependence on more carbon-intensive industries. Furthermore, the mitigation potential of forests depends on assumptions about the decarbonization of other industries and is consequently crucially dependent on the emission scenario. Our findings highlight that trade-offs must be assessed when developing concrete strategies for climate-smart forestry.","Earth Future","Article",2022,0,"10.1029/2022EF002796",NA,"Gregor_2022","included","AV",NA,"v6","VB","management type","unmanaged","base",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,0,0,0,4,"area subject to harvest","Silviculture for removals","Roundwood","harvest","table4","m3/ha/yr (summed over all years)",7.6,284.05,NA,276.45,276.45,"Sequestration positive","mitigation table4","kgC/m2 (convert to /ha)","18000","17000",NA,-1000,NA,-3.67,-0.0132754566829445,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"refOK",7.6,284.05,276.45,18000,17000,-3.67,-0.0132754566829445,-0.0555555555555556,"Eur","reg","Europe",2010,2115,105,"+100",0,1,1,1,0,3,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","Pulp/Paper","Timber","0",1,"Knauf et al., 2015","Knauf et al., 2015","Knauf et al., 2015",1,"external DF used",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,"ongoing QC","area subject to harvest","Temperature:rainfall:CO2 fertilization:disturbance",0.001,"Increased area subject to harvest","Mobilize additional wood by increased forest harvest"

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites. However, a comprehensive substitution analysis of wood-based energy, in respect to environmental benefits, would also require the inclusion of CO2 emissions related to ecosystem processes (e.g. decomposition).","Eur.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites. However, a comprehensive substitution analysis of wood-based energy, in respect to environmental benefits, would also require the inclusion of CO2 emissions related to ecosystem processes (e.g. decomposition).","Eur.

Additionally, they provide many other important ecosystem services (ESs), but are vulnerable to climate change; therefore, adaptation is necessary. Climate-smart forestry combines mitigation with adaptation, whilst facilitating the provision of many ESs. This is particularly challenging due to large uncertainties about future climate. Here, we combined ecosystem modeling with robust multi-criteria optimization to assess how the provision of various ESs (climate change mitigation, timber provision, local cooling, water availability, and biodiversity habitat) can be guaranteed under a broad range of climate futures across Europe. Our optimized portfolios contain 29% unmanaged forests, and implicate a successive conversion of 34% of coniferous to broad-leaved forests (11% vice versa). Coppices practically vanish from Southern Europe, mainly due to their high water requirement. We find the high shares of unmanaged forests necessary to keep European forests a carbon sink while broad-leaved and unmanaged forests contribute to local cooling through biogeophysical effects. Unmanaged forests also pose the largest benefit for biodiversity habitat. However, the increased shares of unmanaged and broad-leaved forests lead to reductions in harvests. This raises the question of how to meet increasing wood demands without transferring ecological impacts elsewhere or enhancing the dependence on more carbon-intensive industries. Furthermore, the mitigation potential of forests depends on assumptions about the decarbonization of other industries and is consequently crucially dependent on the emission scenario. Our findings highlight that trade-offs must be assessed when developing concrete strategies for climate-smart forestry.","Earth Future","Article",2022,0,"10.1029/2022EF002796",NA,"Gregor_2022","included","AV",NA,"v6","VB","management type","base","toNe",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,1,1,0,0,4,"mixed drivers","Multiple strategies","Roundwood","harvest","table4","m3/ha/yr (summed over all years)",284.05,304,NA,19.95,19.95,"Sequestration positive","mitigation table4","kgC/m2 (convert to /ha)","17000","17000",NA,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"refOK",284.05,304,19.95,17000,17000,0,0,0,"Eur","reg","Europe",2010,2115,105,"+100",0,1,1,1,0,3,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","Pulp/Paper","Timber","0",1,"Knauf et al., 2015","Knauf et al., 2015","Knauf et al., 2015",1,"external DF used",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,"ongoing QC","species","supply chain organization:Temperature:rainfall:CO2 fertilization:disturbance",0.001,"Multiple driver","Multiple strategies"

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type.

On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass.

More specifically, we analysed how the use of cloned trees compared with non-cloned trees, together with thinning, nitrogen (N) fertilisation and rotation length (from 60 to 100 years), affects the annual mean production of timber (i.e., saw logs, pulpwood) and energy biomass (i.e., stumps and harvesting residuals in the final felling) and its economic profitability [annual mean of net present value (NPV) with a 2% interest rate]. Furthermore, we employed a life cycle analysis/emission calculation tool to assess the total net CO2 emissions per unit of energy (kg CO2 MW h-1) produced based on energy biomass. We found that both the annual mean production of timber and the NPV increased substantially, regardless of the management regime, if cloned trees with an annual growth increase of up to 30% compared with non-cloned trees were used in regeneration. In general, the use of a short rotation with N fertilisation clearly increased the annual mean of the NPV. Consequently, the use of cloned trees also clearly increased the annual mean production of energy biomass and decreased the total net CO2 emissions per unit of energy produced based on energy biomass. However, the total annual net CO2 emissions were the lowest if a long rotation was used with N fertilisation. To conclude, the use of cloned trees together with intensive management could potentially be highly beneficial for the cost-efficient and sustainable production of timber and energy biomass in an integrated way.","GCB Bioenergy","Article",2013,11,"10.1111/gcbb.12002",NA,"Routa_2013","included","TH",NA,"v5","VB","Unfertilized; 60yr rotation; Improved Productivity of 30% with clonal Norway Spruce","BAU",NA,0,0,2,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,3,0,2,0,0,"mixed drivers","Multiple strategies","Roundwood","Energy biomass yield from unfertilized and fertilized nonclone and clonal species",NA,"m3 ha-1 yr-1",3.2,3.3,NA,0.0999999999999996,0.0999999999999996,"Sequestration positive",NA,"kg CO2 MWh-1 yr-1","-2.5","-0.87",0.348,1.63,NA,0.00163,0.0163000000000001,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"refOK",3.2,3.3,0.0999999999999996,-2.5,-0.87,0.00163,0.0163000000000001,0.652,"std","loc","Finland",2001,2100,100,"71-100",0,1,1,1,NA,3,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","Pulp/Paper","Timber","1",0,"0","0","0",1,"self-calculated DF",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no",NA,"Fix sequestration sign",NA,"ongoing QC","fertilisation","rotation length:species:efficiency improvement:CCS",0.001,"Multiple driver","Multiple strategies"

However, planning horizons and response time to changes in forest management are usually long and the respective GHG effects related to the use of wood depend on the availability of harvested wood. Therefore, an integral long-term strategic approach is required to formulate the most effective forest and wood management strategies for mitigating climate change. The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

This study quantifies the carbon costs and benefits for the French forestry sector in meeting these targets. A forest growth and harvest simulator was developed for French forests using recent forest inventory data, and the wood-use chain was reconstructed from national wood product statistics. We then projected wood production, bioenergy production, and carbon balance for three realistic intensification scenarios and a business-as-usual scenario. These intensification scenarios targeted either overstocked, harvest-delayed or currently actively managed stands. Results: All three intensification strategies produced 11.6-12.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent per year of wood-based energy by 2026, which corresponds to the target assigned to French wood-energy to meet the EU 2020 renewable energy target. Sustaining this level past 2026 will be challenging, let alone further increasing it. Although energy production targets can be reached, the management intensification required will degrade the near-term carbon balance of the forestry sector, compared to continuing present-day management. Even for the best-performing intensification strategy, i.e., reducing the harvest diameter of actively managed stands, the carbon benefits would only become apparent after 2040. The carbon balance of a strategy putting abandoned forests back into production would only break even by 2055; the carbon balance from increasing thinning in managed but untended stands would not break even within the studied time periods, i.e. 2015-2045 and 2046-2100. Owing to the temporal dynamics in the components of the carbon balance, i.e., the biomass stock in the forest, the carbon stock in wood products, and substitution benefits, the merit order of the examined strategies varies over time. Conclusions: No single solution was found to improve the carbon balance of the forestry sector by 2040 in a way that also met energy targets. We therefore searched for the intensification scenario that produces energy at the lowest carbon cost. Reducing rotation time of actively managed stands is slightly more efficient than targeting harvest-delayed stands, but in both cases, each unit of energy produced has a carbon cost that only turns into a benefit between 2060 and 2080.","Carbon Balanc.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Here we present results from a comparative analysis that examined mitigation options for British Columbia's forest sector. Mitigation scenarios were evaluated using a systems perspective that takes into account the changes in emissions and removals in forest ecosystems, in harvested wood product (HWP) carbon stocks, and in other sectors where wood products substitute for emission-intensive materials and fossil fuels. All mitigation activities were assessed relative to a forward-looking 'business as usual' baseline for three implementation levels. In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO(2)e year(-1)over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO(2)e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 MtCO(2)increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 MtCO(2)e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for theHigher Recoveryscenario in 2070. Conclusions The analyses conducted in this study contribute to the global understanding of forest sector mitigation options by providing an integrated framework to synthesize the methods, assumptions, datasets and models needed to quantify mitigation activities using a systems approach. An understanding of economically feasible and socio-economically attractive mitigation scenarios along with trade offs for environmental indicators relating to species composition and age, helps decision makers with long-term planning for land sector contributions to GHG emission reduction efforts, and provides valuable information for stakeholder consultations.","Carbon Balanc.

Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, they provide many other important ecosystem services (ESs), but are vulnerable to climate change; therefore, adaptation is necessary. Climate-smart forestry combines mitigation with adaptation, whilst facilitating the provision of many ESs. This is particularly challenging due to large uncertainties about future climate. Here, we combined ecosystem modeling with robust multi-criteria optimization to assess how the provision of various ESs (climate change mitigation, timber provision, local cooling, water availability, and biodiversity habitat) can be guaranteed under a broad range of climate futures across Europe. Our optimized portfolios contain 29% unmanaged forests, and implicate a successive conversion of 34% of coniferous to broad-leaved forests (11% vice versa). Coppices practically vanish from Southern Europe, mainly due to their high water requirement. We find the high shares of unmanaged forests necessary to keep European forests a carbon sink while broad-leaved and unmanaged forests contribute to local cooling through biogeophysical effects. Unmanaged forests also pose the largest benefit for biodiversity habitat. However, the increased shares of unmanaged and broad-leaved forests lead to reductions in harvests. This raises the question of how to meet increasing wood demands without transferring ecological impacts elsewhere or enhancing the dependence on more carbon-intensive industries. Furthermore, the mitigation potential of forests depends on assumptions about the decarbonization of other industries and is consequently crucially dependent on the emission scenario.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

The carbon balance module simulated changes in the carbon storage in living biomass, dead organic matter and products. Carbon releases from timber harvesting, transporting and manufacturing were included in the carbon balance, as well as the substitution, recycling and reuse effects of different types of wood products (avoided releases from fossil fuels due to the use of wood). Prediction models were developed for the initial pools of wood products and dead organic matter. The results show that collecting branches, stumps and coarse roots for bioenergy improves the carbon balance very little during the first 30 years of biofuel harvesting. This is because decreased carbon balance of forest soil partially cancels the positive substitution effects of fuel feedstock harvesting. Using high thinnings and continuous cover management instead of low thinnings, clear felling and artificial regeneration have an immediate positive effect on the carbon balance. This is because the sizes of the wood product and living biomass pools increase, and manufacturing releases decrease. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

However, planning horizons and response time to changes in forest management are usually long and the respective GHG effects related to the use of wood depend on the availability of harvested wood. Therefore, an integral long-term strategic approach is required to formulate the most effective forest and wood management strategies for mitigating climate change. The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

We evaluated forest sector carbon trends and potential mitigation scenarios in Vermont using a systems-based modeling framework that accounts for net emissions from all forest sector components. These components comprise (1) the forest ecosystem, including land-use change, (2) harvested wood products (HWP), and (3) substitution effects associated with using renewable wood-based products and fuels in place of more emission-intensive materials and fossil fuel-based energy. We assessed baseline carbon trends from 1995 through 2050 using a business as usual (BAU) scenario. Emission reductions associated with different forest management and HWP scenarios were evaluated relative to the BAU scenario from 2020 to 2050. We estimated uncertainty for each forest sector component and used a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the distribution of cumulative total mitigation for each scenario relative to baseline. Our analysis indicates that the strength of the forest sector carbon sink in Vermont has been declining and will continue to decline over coming decades under the BAU scenario. However, several scenarios evaluated here could be effective in reducing emissions and enhancing carbon uptake. Shifting HWP to longer-lived commodities resulted in a 14% reduction in net cumulative emissions by 2050, the largest reduction of all scenarios. A scenario that combined extending harvest rotations, utilizing additional harvest residues for bioenergy, and increasing forest productivity resulted in a 12% reduction in net cumulative emissions. Shifting commodities from pulp and paper to bioenergy showed a 7.3% reduction in emissions. In contrast, shortening rotations to increase harvests for bioenergy use resulted in a 5.5% increase in emissions. In summary, model simulations suggest that net emissions could be reduced by up to 14% relative to BAU, depending on the management and HWP-use scenario. Combining multiple scenarios could further enhance reductions. However, realizing the full climate mitigation potential of these forests may be challenging due to socioeconomic barriers to implementation, as well as alternative management objectives that must be considered along with carbon sequestration.","Ecol.

Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

Here we present results from a comparative analysis that examined mitigation options for British Columbia's forest sector. Mitigation scenarios were evaluated using a systems perspective that takes into account the changes in emissions and removals in forest ecosystems, in harvested wood product (HWP) carbon stocks, and in other sectors where wood products substitute for emission-intensive materials and fossil fuels. All mitigation activities were assessed relative to a forward-looking 'business as usual' baseline for three implementation levels. In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO(2)e year(-1)over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO(2)e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 MtCO(2)increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 MtCO(2)e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for theHigher Recoveryscenario in 2070. Conclusions The analyses conducted in this study contribute to the global understanding of forest sector mitigation options by providing an integrated framework to synthesize the methods, assumptions, datasets and models needed to quantify mitigation activities using a systems approach. An understanding of economically feasible and socio-economically attractive mitigation scenarios along with trade offs for environmental indicators relating to species composition and age, helps decision makers with long-term planning for land sector contributions to GHG emission reduction efforts, and provides valuable information for stakeholder consultations.","Carbon Balanc.

In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO(2)e year(-1)over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO(2)e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 MtCO(2)increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 MtCO(2)e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for theHigher Recoveryscenario in 2070. Conclusions The analyses conducted in this study contribute to the global understanding of forest sector mitigation options by providing an integrated framework to synthesize the methods, assumptions, datasets and models needed to quantify mitigation activities using a systems approach. An understanding of economically feasible and socio-economically attractive mitigation scenarios along with trade offs for environmental indicators relating to species composition and age, helps decision makers with long-term planning for land sector contributions to GHG emission reduction efforts, and provides valuable information for stakeholder consultations.","Carbon Balanc.

This study fills this gap by developing a dynamic life-cycle modeling framework for a cradle-to-grave CLT manufacturing system across 100 years in the Southeastern United States. The framework integrates process-based simulations of CLT manufacturing and forest growth as well as Monte Carlo simulation to address uncertainty. On a 1-ha forest land basis, the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions range from -954 to -1445 metric tonne CO2 eq. for a high forest productivity scenario compared to -609 to -919 metric tonne CO2 eq. for a low forest productivity scenario. All scenarios showed significant GHG emissions from forest residues decay, demonstrating the strong needs to consider forest management and their dynamic impacts in LCAs of CLT or other durable wood products (DWP).

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

However, previous LCAs of CLT are static analyses without considering the complex interactions between the CLT manufacturing and forest systems, which are dynamic and largely affected by the variations in forest management, CLT manufacturing, and end-of-life options. This study fills this gap by developing a dynamic life-cycle modeling framework for a cradle-to-grave CLT manufacturing system across 100 years in the Southeastern United States. The framework integrates process-based simulations of CLT manufacturing and forest growth as well as Monte Carlo simulation to address uncertainty.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

We evaluated forest sector carbon trends and potential mitigation scenarios in Vermont using a systems-based modeling framework that accounts for net emissions from all forest sector components. These components comprise (1) the forest ecosystem, including land-use change, (2) harvested wood products (HWP), and (3) substitution effects associated with using renewable wood-based products and fuels in place of more emission-intensive materials and fossil fuel-based energy. We assessed baseline carbon trends from 1995 through 2050 using a business as usual (BAU) scenario. Emission reductions associated with different forest management and HWP scenarios were evaluated relative to the BAU scenario from 2020 to 2050. We estimated uncertainty for each forest sector component and used a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the distribution of cumulative total mitigation for each scenario relative to baseline. Our analysis indicates that the strength of the forest sector carbon sink in Vermont has been declining and will continue to decline over coming decades under the BAU scenario. However, several scenarios evaluated here could be effective in reducing emissions and enhancing carbon uptake. Shifting HWP to longer-lived commodities resulted in a 14% reduction in net cumulative emissions by 2050, the largest reduction of all scenarios. A scenario that combined extending harvest rotations, utilizing additional harvest residues for bioenergy, and increasing forest productivity resulted in a 12% reduction in net cumulative emissions. Shifting commodities from pulp and paper to bioenergy showed a 7.3% reduction in emissions. In contrast, shortening rotations to increase harvests for bioenergy use resulted in a 5.5% increase in emissions. In summary, model simulations suggest that net emissions could be reduced by up to 14% relative to BAU, depending on the management and HWP-use scenario. Combining multiple scenarios could further enhance reductions. However, realizing the full climate mitigation potential of these forests may be challenging due to socioeconomic barriers to implementation, as well as alternative management objectives that must be considered along with carbon sequestration.","Ecol.

In particular, we studied the effects of thinning, nitrogen fertilization, and rotation length on: (1) the production of timber and energy biomass, and its economic profitability (net present value), (2) carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and carbon balance in forestry, and (3) carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the use of biomass in energy production. Results showed that the current Finnish baseline management with and without nitrogen fertilization resulted in the highest mean annual timber production and net present value (NPV) for long rotations (60 to 80 years), regardless of climate scenario. Mean annual production of energy biomass was enhanced by increasing stocking by 20-30 % compared to the baseline management, and/or use of nitrogen fertilization. Such management gave lower CO2 emissions per unit of energy compared to the baseline management, as the carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and the carbon balance in forestry increased. Overall, the carbon neutrality and net present value were, on average, the highest in the baseline management or with a 20 % increase in stocking, with nitrogen fertilization and 60- to 80-year rotation lengths, regardless of the climate applied.

Here we present results from a comparative analysis that examined mitigation options for British Columbia's forest sector. Mitigation scenarios were evaluated using a systems perspective that takes into account the changes in emissions and removals in forest ecosystems, in harvested wood product (HWP) carbon stocks, and in other sectors where wood products substitute for emission-intensive materials and fossil fuels. All mitigation activities were assessed relative to a forward-looking 'business as usual' baseline for three implementation levels. In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO(2)e year(-1)over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO(2)e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 MtCO(2)increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 MtCO(2)e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for theHigher Recoveryscenario in 2070. Conclusions The analyses conducted in this study contribute to the global understanding of forest sector mitigation options by providing an integrated framework to synthesize the methods, assumptions, datasets and models needed to quantify mitigation activities using a systems approach. An understanding of economically feasible and socio-economically attractive mitigation scenarios along with trade offs for environmental indicators relating to species composition and age, helps decision makers with long-term planning for land sector contributions to GHG emission reduction efforts, and provides valuable information for stakeholder consultations.","Carbon Balanc.

Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The carbon balance module simulated changes in the carbon storage in living biomass, dead organic matter and products. Carbon releases from timber harvesting, transporting and manufacturing were included in the carbon balance, as well as the substitution, recycling and reuse effects of different types of wood products (avoided releases from fossil fuels due to the use of wood). Prediction models were developed for the initial pools of wood products and dead organic matter. The results show that collecting branches, stumps and coarse roots for bioenergy improves the carbon balance very little during the first 30 years of biofuel harvesting. This is because decreased carbon balance of forest soil partially cancels the positive substitution effects of fuel feedstock harvesting. Using high thinnings and continuous cover management instead of low thinnings, clear felling and artificial regeneration have an immediate positive effect on the carbon balance. This is because the sizes of the wood product and living biomass pools increase, and manufacturing releases decrease. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways.

Karst) stands under the changing climate. We employed a forest ecosystem model and life cycle assessment tool. In particular, we studied the effects of thinning, nitrogen fertilization, and rotation length on: (1) the production of timber and energy biomass, and its economic profitability (net present value), (2) carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and carbon balance in forestry, and (3) carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the use of biomass in energy production. Results showed that the current Finnish baseline management with and without nitrogen fertilization resulted in the highest mean annual timber production and net present value (NPV) for long rotations (60 to 80 years), regardless of climate scenario. Mean annual production of energy biomass was enhanced by increasing stocking by 20-30 % compared to the baseline management, and/or use of nitrogen fertilization. Such management gave lower CO2 emissions per unit of energy compared to the baseline management, as the carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and the carbon balance in forestry increased. Overall, the carbon neutrality and net present value were, on average, the highest in the baseline management or with a 20 % increase in stocking, with nitrogen fertilization and 60- to 80-year rotation lengths, regardless of the climate applied. However, it was not possible to simultaneously maximize the NPV of forest biomass production and the carbon neutrality of bioenergy use.","BioEnergy Res.","Article",2014,23,"10.1007/s12155-013-9372-x",NA,"Pyorala_2014","included","TH","SL","v6","VB","Fertilization","RB 30-50 years","RBF 30-50 years",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,"fertilisation","Silviculture for productivity","Roundwood","mean annual production of energy biomass","Table2","m3 ha-1 a-1",3.5,3.8,"1.0857142857142856",0.3,0.612244897959183,"Emissions positive","Table 5","g CO2m−2 a−1","-19.5","-189",NA,-169.5,NA,-1.695,-2.7685,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"refOK",3.5,3.8,0.612244897959183,19.5,189,1.695,2.7685,8.69230769230769,"prd","loc","Finland",NA,NA,50,"31-70",0,1,0,1,NA,2,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","0","Timber","0",1,"Statistics Finalns (ref 47 in the paper)",NA,NA,1,"external DF used",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no",NA,"change wood variable to harvested m3",NA,"ongoing QC","fertilisation","",0.001,"Increased fertilisation","Mobilize additional wood by increased forest growth"

Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
